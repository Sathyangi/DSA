### 2. QueueStack – Pop Friendly
- Stack implemented using two Queues
- Push: O(n)
- Pop: O(1)
- File: QueueStackPopFriendly.java

### 3. Unbounded Array Stack
- Stack implemented using dynamic array
- Automatically grows and shrinks
- File: DynamicArrayStack.java

### 4. StackQueue – Enqueue Friendly
- Queue implemented using two Stacks
